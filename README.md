# DKE-Project-2-2 Group 4

You can run the code in two ways in the Main class in Group9 folder or if you want to see the run visually you run the Gui class in the Group9.gui2 folder.
However you have to change the file path for your map first in the class you want to run it from (Main or Gui).


To change the intruder or the guards that you plan on testing you change them in the AgentsFactory class in the Group4 folder.
Line 27 for intruders, and line 35 for guards (these line correspond the the handed in version)
